Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you
Going out tonight, changes into something red, her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost
We're only getting older, baby

Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of

Feel the rhythm in my chest, just breathe
I will stay
So the lantern in your heart won't fade
The secrets you tell me, I'll take to my grave
There's bones in my closet, but you hang stuff anyway
And if you have nightmares, we'll dance on the bed
I know that you love me, love me
Even when I lose my head
Guillotine, guillotine
Even when I lose my head
Guillotine, guillotine
Even when I lose my head
Kiss my lips
Feel the rhythm of your heart and hips
I will pray
So the castle that we've built won't cave
The secrets you tell me, I'll take to my grave
There's bones in my closet, but you hang stuff anyway
And if you have nightmares, we'll dance on the bed
I know that you love me, love me
Even when I lose my head
Guillotine, guillotine

If you're in complete control?
Hey ma, hey ma, hey
Hey ma, hey ma, hey
Come to my house and take me home
Sucked up by a wave, shot to outer space
Stranded, but I'm not alone
Fall into your blue
Fall into your blue
Fighting it is hopeless, sinkin' in your ocean
Just like He designed me to do
Fall into your blue
Sunrise in your bed, purple, yellow, red
Only when it's you and me
Take me to the edge, drag me through your lens
Show me what I need to see
Hey ma, hey ma, hey
Hey ma, hey ma, hey
Come to my house and take me home
Avenues and lanes, parachutes and planes
Push me out, away we go
Fall into your blue
Fall into your blue
Fighting it is hopeless, sinkin' in your ocean
Just like He designed me to do
Fall into your blue
Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home
Fall into your blue
Fall into your blue
Fighting it is hopeless, sinkin' in your ocean
Just like He designed me to do
Fall into your blueOur love will never be another
You're just a devil undercover 
Found you when you were in the gutter 
Shit was sweet until I was a sucker, shout out Jonas Brothers
I learned more than I cared to discover 
Don't you know that I'm more than a come up? 
You act up and then act like it's nothin' 
Sold your soul, you stone cold, you a stunner 
Every time you left , shit was never right 
In another bed  every single night 
Had it to a science , you were so precise 
See it in your eyes , saw you in the light 
Somehow, mami, I still want you
Listen to me, don't drive away 
Kill me softly, your hold on me is 
Somethin' I can't explain
I know you could never be my bitch 
Shit could never be like this 
I know, stop thinkin' you're in my plans 
Hunnid times you blew another chance 
I know you were gettin' down on the low 
Then runnin' back to me in the morning 
I know shit could never be like this
You could never be my bitch
No, no
Our love will never be another 
You're just a devil undercover 
Found you when you were in the gutter 
Shit was sweet until I was a sucker 
Rather be single for life 
Than be fuckin' with you
I ain't rollin' the dice, no 
I ain't playin' to lose 
Every time you left, shit was never right 
In another bed  every single night 
Had it to a science, you were so precise 
See it in your eyes, saw you in the light 
Somehow, mami, I still want you 
Listen to me, don't drive away 
Kill me softly, your hold on me is 
Somethin' I can't explain
I know you could never be my bitch 
Shit could never be like this 
I know, stop thinkin' you're in my plans 
Hunnid times you blew another chance 
I know you were gettin' down on the low 
Then runnin' back to me in the morning
I know shit could never be like this 
You could never be my bitch
No, no
Be my bitch
It could never be like this
Shit could never be like this
It could never be like thisWhat's poppin'? 
Brand new whip, just hopped in 
I got options 
I could pass that bitch like Stockton 
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in 
My body got rid of them toxins 
SportsCenter, top ten
I could put the ball in the end zone
Put a bad bitch in the friendzone, ooh
This shit sound like an intro
Jetson, give me that tempo, ooh
Told Pooh he a fool with this shit 
Told her don't let her friends know 
In the 'Ville and I move like a don 
Eating fettuccine at Vincenzo's
Me and my 'migos got that free smoke
On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls 
Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego 
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego 
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, "Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?" 
Certified freak ho
Hang around us and she learnin' my lingo
Back then, wasn't worried 'bout me though
In the gym tryna work on my free throw
Goddamn 
Spending money at the club like Sam's 
Yes, ma'am
She a lil' freak on cam 
But she don't put this on the 'Gram 
Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram 
I can't switch on the fam 
Shit's hot, hit the switch on the fan 
This where my head is 
I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings 
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections 
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section 
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession 
I like to call it a passion
I can't be sitting relaxin' 
PG, we getting some traction
I'm at the venue, it's packed in 
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me
And she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction
That's my type and she Latin 
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand new sheets for the bed, they satin 
Y'all wasn't tuned in back then 
My swag, they keep jackin' 
I ain't doin' no verse, quit askin' 
What's poppin'? 
Brand new whip, just hopped in 
I got options
I could pass that bitch like Stockton 
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in 
My body got rid of them toxins 
SportsCenter, top ten
